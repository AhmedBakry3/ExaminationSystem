# ExaminationSystem

**ExaminationSystem** is a console-based system developed in **C# basics** with the application of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. It allows users to create, manage, and evaluate practical and final exams, supporting multiple question types such as **Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)** and **True/False (TF)** questions.

While working with **C# basics**, I faced several challenges in structuring the program and managing user input, but through persistence and careful design, I was able to create a functioning and scalable system. This project helped me understand how OOP concepts can be applied effectively even with foundational knowledge of the language.
